# Guide for Localization in GitHub

All localization files of the Surf app are stored on GitHub. You need a GitHub account to access them. If you havenâ€™t previously used GitHub, please [create one](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).

## Create a repository copy

All changes to the strings you make in your own repository without affecting the original TON Surf repository. This step is performed only once, you don't need to create a copy of repository every time you want to edit strings.

1. Go to the [TON-Surf-Localization](https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-Surf-Localization) repository.

Do not close the tab. We recommend you to add this webpage to your Favourites or Bookmarks in your browser to easily revisit it later.

## Switch to the right branch

It's extremely important to edit strings in the latest version of file. Otherwise, your changes can cause conflicts when merging them.
First, please check the current Surf version number. Then, switch to the Github branch with the same number to get the file latest version.

1. Open [Surf for Translators](https://ton-surf-translate.firebaseapp.com/). If opening for the fist time, please comply with legal requirements as described in the [Help Center](https://help.ever.surf/en/support/solutions/articles/77000236686-do-i-need-to-register-to-use-surf-).
2. On the main screen, click the Settings icon.

## Check a string ID

2. In the upper left corner, click the Surf icon.

Every ID consists of keys separated with commas. Knowing the string ID you can search the localization file for keys and find the string you need. For example, the string ID **TON-Surf.setup.promoCards.faq.initial** consists of the following keys:
